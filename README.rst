OpenAIRE Guidelines
===================
Welcome to the OpenAIRE Guidelines. The intention of this is to provide a public space to share OpenAIREs work on interoperability and to engage with the community. The OpenAIRE Guidelines helps repository managers expose publications, datasets and CRIS metadata via the OAI-PMH protocol in order to integrate with OpenAIRE infrastructure.

Head over to http://guidelines.openaire.eu to read the guidelines.

OpenAIRE Guidelines consists of three guidelines for publication repositories, data archives and CRIS systems respectively:

- OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repositories
- OpenAIRE Guidelines for Data Archives
- OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers based on CERIF-XML
