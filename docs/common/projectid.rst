An authoritative `list of projects <https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/search-api/projects>`_ is exposed via OpenAIRE Graph's Search API for projects that allows repository managers to access metadata records by performing queries over projects. Values include the project name and project ID. The projectID equals the Grant Agreement identifier, and is defined by the `info:eu-repo namespace <http://purl.org/eu-repo/semantics/#info-eu-repo-GrantAgreementIdentifiers>`_ term grantAgreement. The API is intended for metadata discovery and exploration only, hence it does not provide access to the whole information space: the number of total results returned by one query is limited to 10,000. For accessing the whole graph, repository managers are encouraged to use the OpenAIRE full Graph dataset.

The syntax is::

   info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/Funder/FundingProgram/ProjectID/
   [Jurisdiction]/[ProjectName]/[ProjectAcronym]

where:

* ``Funder`` refers to the funding organization (e.g., ``EC`` for European Commission, ``WT`` for Wellcome Trust)
* ``FundingProgramme`` refers to a specific programme (e.g., ``FP7`` for Framework Programme Seven, ``H2020`` for Horizon 2020, ``HE`` for Horizon Europe )
* ``ProjectID`` refers to a unique identifier in the scope of the funder (and maybe the programme), e.g. a grant agreement number.
* ``Jurisdiction`` refers to the authority granted to a formally constituted legal body (e.g. ``EU`` for European Union)
* ``ProjectName`` contains the full name of the project
* ``ProjectAcronym`` contains the projectâ€™s acronym.

For OpenAIRE compatibility, the elements in square brackets are optional. The three-part namespace is *mandatory when applicable* (``info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/Funder/FundingProgram/ProjectID``), while the six-parts namespace is *recommended*.

When omitting fields in the extended version, the number of fields must be preserved by using ``/``. A correct example for omitting the the ``ProjectName`` field would therefore look like this: ``EC/FP7/12345/EU//OpenAIREplus``

If any of the field values contains a forward slash (``/``), it needs to be escaped using URL encoding (``%2F``). For instance, ``My/Project`` would be represented as ``My%2FProject``.
