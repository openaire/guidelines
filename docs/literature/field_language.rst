DC Field

``dc:language``

Usage

*Recommended*

DCMI Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A language of the intellectual content of the resource.

Usage Instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A specific resource (an instance of scientific output) is either written in one human language or more. In these cases all used languages are used in the DC element ``language``. If a specific resource (an instance of scientific output) is written in one human language and is translated into other human languages, each translation does have its own record..

Recommended: ISO 639-x, where x can be 1,2 or 3. Best Practice: we use ISO 639-3 and by doing so we follow: http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/

If necessary, repeat this element to indicate multiple languages.

If ISO 639-2 and 639-1 are sufficient for the contents of a repository they can be used alternatively. Since there is a unique mapping this can be done during an aggregation process.
