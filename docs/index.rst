Welcome to the OpenAIRE Guidelines. The intention of this is to provide a public space to share OpenAIREs work on interoperability and to engage with the community. The OpenAIRE Guidelines helps repository managers expose publications, datasets and CRIS metadata via the OAI-PMH protocol in order to integrate with OpenAIRE infrastructure.

OpenAIRE Guidelines have been released for publication repositories, data archives, CRIS systems, software repositories and repositories of other research products respectively:

OpenAIRE Validator
------------------
The `OpenAIRE Validator service <https://www.openaire.eu/validator-registration-guide>`_ is integrated in the `Content Provider Dashboard <https://provide.openaire.eu/>`_ and allows to test your repository's compatibility with the OpenAIRE Guidelines.

If validation succeeds the data source can be registered for regular aggregation and indexing in OpenAIRE.
OpenAIRE allows for registration of institutional and thematic repositories registered in OpenDOAR, research data repositories registered in re3data, individual e-Journals, CRIS, aggregators and publishers.

Horizon 2020 Open Access Requirements
-------------------------------------

The European Commission has published `Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf>`_ (version 1.0, 11-Dec-2013). By following the :ref:`literature` it is ensured that specific requirements on bibliographic information about Open Access publications are met. These requirements are summarized here:
